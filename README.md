# graylog-contentpack-plesk-web
A contentpack to get Apache log from the Plesk Control panel into Graylog

This is a content pack, with instructions how to get our logs from the Plesk Web Panel Apache HTTP server into Graylog2. 

The package is inspired on similar work for Nginx from https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog-contentpack-nginx and 
aims to achieve maximum compatibility with this packege at all levels, so the dashboards, streams and other useful
stuff from that contentpack can be re-used
